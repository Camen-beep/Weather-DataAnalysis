# 🌍 Global Warming in Hong Kong Data Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This is a project where I used the **METEO API** to collect weather data in Hong Kong, and analyze meteorological data.

The analysis focuses on:  
- Annual average temperature in Hong Kong (1990–2025)  
- Seasonal average temperature in Hong Kong (1990–2025)  

This project is suitable for those who want to practice **Python data processing** and are interested in **global climate trends**.
